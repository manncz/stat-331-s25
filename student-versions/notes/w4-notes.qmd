Download the data that we will be using this week at the followings links and add them to a `data/` directory

[IMDb data](data/imdb_data.Rdata)

[Rainfall data](data/2023-rainfall-slo.xlsx)

[Eras Tour data](data/TS_data.xlsx)

## Data Joins

## .Rdata Files

Once in `R`, data frames can be saves as `.Rdata` files using the syntax:

`save(data_frame1, data_frame2, ..., file = "path/file-name.Rdata")`

and then *loaded* into `R` using the syntax:

`load("path/file-name.Rdata")`

This can be preferable when saving intermediate datasets in an analysis because `.Rdata` files are much smaller and more memory efficient than `.csv` files. Additionally, you can save and load multiple data frames at once!

You can see that this is useful here, where we have 7 related data frames saved in `imdb_data.Rdata`, which are then loaded in one line below.
::: 

We will use 7 datasets that describe movies from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/). 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between data sets in IMDb movie data."
#| out-width: 90%
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/manncz/stat-331/blob/main/lecture_slides/W4_joins/images/imdb_relational.png?raw=true")
```


```{r}
load(file = "data/imdb_data.Rdata")
```





On Wednesday will also look at joining datasets created from the Lab 2 Rodent data. **Note that you will need to change the file path to be appropriate for your directory strucure!**

```{r, rodent-data}
rodent <- read_csv("../../lab_assignments/lab2/surveys.csv")
species <- rodent |> 
  select(genus:taxa, species_id) |> 
  distinct()

measurements <- rodent |> 
  select(genus, species, sex:weight) |> 
  rename(genus_name = genus)
```


## Data Pivots

Example data includes the `cereal` dataset from the `liver` package (which we saw last week)...

```{r}
library(liver)
data(cereal)
```

```{r}
mean_protein <- cereal |> 
  group_by(manuf, shelf) |> 
  summarize(mean_protein = mean(protein))


mean_protein |> 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = manuf,
              names_from = shelf,
              values_from = mean_protein)
```


... and daily rainfall observed in SLO in January 2023. 
[Data source](cesanluisobispo.ucanr.edu)


```{r}
slo_rainfall <- read_excel("data/2023-rainfall-slo.xlsx")

slo_rainfall <- slo_rainfall |> 
  mutate(across(Sunday:Saturday, as.numeric))
```


## Factors with `forcats`

To practice working with factor variables, we will use data on songs that Taylor Swift included in the Era's Tour.

```{r}
full_eras <- read_excel("data/TS_data.xlsx", sheet = "full")
```
