## Running Code

```{r}
1 + 1
2 + 1
```


## Packages

1. Install the package `ggplot2` in the *console* or using the "Packages" tab in the RStudio viewer.

2. Load the `ggplot2` package in the code chunk below:

```{r}

```


## Data Types & Variables


```{r}
message <- "So long and thanks for all the fish"
year <- 2025
the_answer <- 42
earth_demolished <- FALSE
```

Data types:
- `message` is:
- `year` is:
- `the_answer` is:
- `earth_demolished` is:


## Data Structures

- vector

```{r}
vec <- c(1, 2, 3)
```

- matrix

```{r}
mat <- matrix(seq(1:9), ncol = 3)
```

- list

```{r}
li <- list(vec = vec,
           mat = mat,
           other = c("a", "b", "c"))
```

- dataframe 

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = c("a", "b", "c"),
                 y = c(1, 2, 3))
```

## Indexing

**Try it:**

- index the second and third elements of the **vector** `vec`

```{r}

```

- index the first **row** of the **matrix** `mat`

```{r}

```

- index the third element of the second **column** of the **matrix** `mat`

```{r}

```

- index the second element of the **list** `li`

```{r}

```

- in *three* different ways, index the column `y` in the **dataframe** `df`

```{r}

```


## Logic

```{r}
a <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
b <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)

a & b   # AND

a | b   # OR

!a & b  # NOT X AND Y
```

## Logic & Indexing

```{r}
vec > 2
```

```{r}
vec[vec > 2]
```


## Vectorization


```{r}
vec + 1

mat + 1
```


```{r}
mean(vec)
sd(vec)
```


```{r}
sum(a | b)
```

**Try it:** find the proportion of elements in the matrix `mat` that are less than 4

```{r}
# your code here

```


## Errors

### Syntax Errors

We want to do the following:

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)
```

Note the errors:

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1
```

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 10 by = 1)
```

```{r}
sequence(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)
```

### Object-type Errors

```{r}
sqrt('1')
```

```{r}
my_obj <- seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)

my_obj(5)
```


### Some Common Errors

```{r}
some_ojb <- 1:10

mean(some_obj)
```

> Error: Object `some_obj` not found.

- probably means:


```{r}
mean[1, 2]
```

> Error: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable.

- probably means:


```{r}
"a" + 2
```

> Error: Non-numeric argument to binary operator.

- probaby means:

*Try it:*

```{r}
matrix(c("a", "b", "c", "d"), num_row = 2)
```
