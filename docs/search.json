Write your own code to complete the steps, in the order given below.\nHint: To update a vector after performing an operation, you overwrite the existing object with the updated version. This looks something like this:\nx &lt;- x + 12,\nwhere the original value(s) in x have had 12 added to them, and the resulting values are put back in to the object named x.\nBe careful not to overwrite more than you intend.

The code below verifies that this is true for your top_secret object!\nHint: This is what is called a “relational” comparison, where you compare an object to a number and R will give you a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs based on whether the comparison is / is not met. You can then use these TRUEs and FALSEs as numbers, since TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0 in R land.\n\n# Write code to verify that there are 352 numbers with values **below** 17\n\nNext, carry out the following steps:\n\nTurn your vector of numbers into a matrix with 5 columns. (I would recommend naming this something different than top_secret and informative such as secret_mat.)\n\n\n## Write code to carry out step 4.\n\n\nSeparately from your top secret numbers, create a vector of all the even numbers between 1 and 382. Name it evens. That is, evens should contain 2, 4, 6, 8 …, 382.\n\n\n## Write code to carry out step 5.\n\n\nSubtract the “evens” vector from the first column of your secret message matrix.\n\n\n## Write code to carry out step 6.\n\n\nSubtract 100 from all numbers in the 18-24th rows of the 3rd column of your secret message matrix.\n\n\n## Complete the code to carry out step 7.\n\n\nMultiply all numbers in the 4th and 5th column of your secret message matrix by 2.\n\n\n## Code to carry out step 8.\n\n\nTurn your secret message matrix back into a vector.\n\n\n## Write code to carry out step 9.\n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, all numbers in indices 500 and beyond are below 100. The code below verifies that this is true for your top_secret object!\n\n# Write code to verify that indices 500 and beyond have values **below** 100\n\n\nTake the square root of all numbers in indices 38 to 465.\nUse the round() function to round all numbers to the nearest whole number.\nReplace all instances of the number 39 with 20.\n\n\nThis step requires another relational comparison, but this time it is equality. Equality in R is checked with a double equal sign rather than a single equal sign!\n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that your final message should have 344 even numbers.\nHint: Checking for divisibility is an interesting operation that isn’t done much in R. Modulus is the operation you are interested in, where you are checking for whether the numbers are divisible by 2, with no remainder. See what you can find about modulus in R!\n\n# Code to verify how many even numbers are in your top_secret vector\n# Should be 344!",

    "section": "Assessments",
    "text": "Assessments\n\nGeneral Evaluation Criteria\nIn every assignment, discussion, and written component of this class, you are expected to demonstrate that you are intellectually engaging with the material. I will evaluate you based on this engagement, which means that technically correct but low effort answers which do not demonstrate engagement or understanding will receive no credit.\nWhen you answer questions in this class, your goal is to show that you either understand the material or are actively engaging with it. If you did not achieve this goal, then your answer is incomplete, regardless of whether or not it is technically correct. This is not to encourage you to add unnecessary complexity to your answer - simple, elegant solutions are always preferable to unwieldly, complex solutions that accomplish the same task.\nWhile this is not an English class, grammar and spelling are important, as is your ability to communicate technical information in writing; both of these criteria will be used in addition to assignment-specific rubrics to evaluate your work.\n\n\nFormative Assessments\n\nCheck-ins\nEach week, you will find short Check-In questions or tasks throughout the text to make sure you are prepared for class that week. Check-Ins are based on the material in each week’s reading from the textbook. Note that the Canvas Check-in quizzes can be submitted two two times and your highest score will be kept, so you should get close to 100% on this part of the course!\n\nCheck-ins are (typically) due Tuesdays before class.\n\nSection 70: 9:00am\nSection 71: 12:00pm\n\n\n\n\nPractice Activities\nMost Tuesdays’s, you will be given a Practice Activity to complete, to get the hang of the week’s necessary R skills. These activities will always result in a single, straightforward correct answer, that you will submit via Canvas (two attempts, the average score being kept).\nSince these activities are intended to be your first attempt at new skills, they are meant to be done with help from me and your peers. Therefore, you will always be given some time in class to work on them.\n\nPractice Activities are (typically) due Thursdays before class.\n\nSection 70: 9:00am\nSection 71: 12:00pm\n\n\n\n\nLab Assignments\nYour typical homework assignments will be weekly labs. You will follow each lab’s instructions to complete tasks in R and submit a rendered .html Quarto document to Canvas.\nMost weeks, there will be class time on Wednesdays dedicated to working on completing lab assignments. While you will work with peers during class time on Thursdays, you will be expected to submit your own individual work for the final submission.\n\nLabs are (typically) due on Mondays (of the following week) at 11:59pm.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluative Assessments\n\nFinal Project\nThere will be a data analysis project to be completed throughout the second half of the term. You will work in a group of 3-4 people. Each group will produce a written project report covering linear regression and model simulation. More information will follow on Canvas.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be a midterm exam and a final exam. The midterm will have both in-class and take-home portions. The final will be entirely in-class during our scheduled final exam slot. More information will follow.\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Grade\nYour grade in STAT 331/531 will contain the following components:\n\n\n\nAssignments\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nCheck-ins\n5%\n\n\nPractice Activities\n10%\n\n\nLab Assignments\n30%\n\n\nMidterm Exam\n15%\n\n\nFinal Project\n15%\n\n\nFinal Exam\n25%\n\n\n\nLower bounds for grade cutoffs are shown in the following table. It is possible that I could lower any of the grade cutoffs. You will only have the opportunity for grade rounding if you completed all assignments in the course. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter grade\nX +\nX\nX -\n\n\n\n\nA\n.\n93\n90\n\n\nB\n87\n83\n80\n\n\nC\n77\n73\n70\n\n\nD\n67\n63\n60\n\n\nF\n&lt;60\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of this table:\n\nA grade of 85 will receive a B.\nA grade of 77 will receive a C+.\nA grade of 70 will receive a C-.\nAnything below a 60 will receive an F.",

    "text": "Course Policies\n\nAttendance & Participation\nI do not take formal attendance in this class. However, it is my expectation that you remain in class and on task until you have finished all your activities and assignments.\nIf you are feeling ill, please do not come to class.\nHere’s what you should do if you do miss a class:\n\nTalk to a classmate to figure out what information you missed\nCheck Canvas for any necessary handouts or changes to assignments\nPost on Discord with any questions you have after reviewing notes and handouts\n\nIf you miss a bunch of classes, please come talk to me. I’m working from the assumption that you care and are trying, but something is getting in your way (health issues? college stress? work?); let’s figure out what that is and how I can help.\n\n\nAccessibility and Accomodations\nI have taken numerous steps to ensure that all of the materials presented in this course are accessible to all participants, regardless of physical or learning disabilities. I know that everyone is unique and I may have unintentionally overlooked something that limits access to some materials or activities. Please let me know if you cannot access any content. If you find you need additional accommodations to complete the required course work, please contact me as soon as possible! I want to support your success.\nIf you wish to request disability-related accommodations such as extra exam time for this or any other course, please contact the Disability Resource Center. It’s important to do this with as much advanced notice as possible, so you have full access to your course materials and activities in a timely manner. Please also email me to let me know that I should expect an email from the DRC to get you the accommodations that you need.\n\n\nInclusive Classroom\nBecause data are collected by and about humans, data necessarily encode aspects of our proclivities and biases. As a result, this course may touch upon difficult topics related to race, gender, inequality, class, and oppression. We each come into this class with different perspectives that can be shared to enhance our understanding of these issues. I ask that you enter these conversations with respect, curiosity, and cultural humility. You should be open to alternative perspectives and be willing to revise beliefs that are based on misinformation. As a general rule, your ideas and experiences can always be shared during these conversations, but please refrain from dismissing the experiences of others. Personal attacks of any kind will not be tolerated.\n\n\nGroup Work\nThis course will rely heavily on in-class group work. You will be expected to work with classmates on in-class material. If you have concerns about random group assignment, please talk to me at the start of the term.\nYou are also encouraged to discuss your ideas for lab assignments; however, I expect that these collaborations are about ideas and no R code is shared. Each person’s lab assignment submissions are expected to reflect their own thinking, and thus copying the work of others does not provide me with any information about your learning.\nThe community standards for student-to-student and student-to-instructor interactions include the following:\n\nListen actively and attentively.\nAsk for clarification if you are confused.\nChallenge one another respectfully.\nGracefully accept constructive criticism.\nTake responsibility for the quality of the discussion and the work.\nDo not monopolize discussion.\nAcknowledge that everyone has something to offer.\nSpeak from your own experience, without generalizing.\n\n\n\nLate Policy\nEveryone will be given a “bank” of 4 deadline extensions which can be used on Check-ins, Practice Activities, and Lab Assignments at any point in the quarter. One deadline extension will get you a 24 hour extension on a given assignment. You can use all of your deadline extensions on one assignment or split them up in any way.\n\nLike how the “real world” works, you must request a deadline extension before the deadline. To use your deadline extensions, you need to email me before the assignment deadline. You don’t need to get a response from me, you just need to email me at least a minute before the deadline.\nIf you do not email me before the assignment deadline (or you run out of late days), you will be docked 20% for each day that the assignment is late. (e.g. you can get a maximum of 80% on the assignment if it is submitted within 24 hours after the original due date and time.)\n\nA note on this policy: my priority is for all of you to engage with and understand the course materials. The best way to achieve this is to complete all assignments and receive feedback on your work. At the same time, I understand that things happen outside of our control and that you are balancing many responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic Canvas Settings\n\n\n\nCanvas is set up to automatically input 0% for missing assignments (as an incentive to go complete the assignment) and apply the 20% grade deduction policy. I will need to manually adjust your grade when you use your “deadline extensions.” You are responsible for double checking your grade to make sure I didn’t miss anything.\n\n\nIf you find yourself with extenuating circumstances beyond the defined late policy, please email me before the due date.\n\n\nExam Conflicts\nIf you have a known conflict with an exam, please discuss it with me at least three weeks prior to the exam date. If an illness or a family emergency arises, please let me know as soon as possible, and we will work out a solution. This may involve taking the exam at a later date or replacing the missed exam score with the final exam score. If you are unable to take the final exam, you will likely receive an Incomplete in the course.",

You do not need to seek out additional resources all on your own – we can figure out what additional resources you may need.\n\nYou will be doing your best to engage with what we are all doing together during class. This means that you are using technology (i.e. laptops/tablets/phones) for class activities and not in ways that distract you.\nYou will approach the course with academic integrity.\nYou will come to class on time and work on class material with your peers.\nEveryone can learn the material in this course.\n\nFor Me:\n\nI am responsible for ensuring that all students feel welcome and valued in the classroom.\nI am responsible for providing the resources necessary so that all students in the course can achieve the learning objectives.\nI am responsible for providing prompt and clear feedback on your coursework.\nI welcome and appreciate any actionable feedback regarding how the class is meeting your learning needs. We can discuss ways to adjust the course to ensure it is supporting your learning and do more of anything that is working well!\n\n\nMake Mistakes!\nProgramming is the process of making a series of silly or stupid mistakes, and then slowly fixing each mistake (while adding a few more). The only way to know how to fix these mistakes (and avoid them in the future) is to make them. (Sometimes, you have to make the same mistake a few dozen times before you can avoid it in the future). At some point during the class, you will find that you’ve spent 30 minutes staring at an error caused by a typo, a space, a parenthesis in the wrong place. You may ask for help debugging this weird error, only to have someone immediately point out the problem… it is always easier to see these things in someone else’s code. This is part of programming, it is normal, and you shouldn’t feel embarrassed or sorry (unless you put no effort into troubleshooting the problem before you asked for help)\nIf you manage to produce an error I haven’t seen before, then congratulations. You have achieved something special, and that achievement should be celebrated. Each new and bizarre error is an opportunity to learn a bit more about the programming language, the operating system, or the interaction between the two.",

    "text": "Academic Integrity and Class Conduct\nOur academic community is at its best when we treat each other with fairness, honesty, respect, and trust. Unfortunately, sometimes students slip up and do something that gives themselves (or someone else) an unfair advantage over other students. Such actions will not be tolerated in this class.\nIt is most likely that a student will slip up if they are feeling overwhelmed or unsure of how to approach a problem that they are stuck on. So let’s be proactive to prevent those situations!! If you are helpless in an assignment or in studying, post on discord, come to office hours, or email me or one of your classmates! I am working hard to provide all of the resources you need to succeed\nHowever, the college doesn’t really care if you break the rules on purpose or by accident. If I suspect you have done something that violates academic integrity on any graded elements of the course (included those graded for completion), you will receive an email to tell you about my suspicion and how the situation will be handled. Typically, students earn a 0 for the assignment on which academic misconduct is found. University policy dictates that we must report every instance of suspected academic dishonesty to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, no matter how small. For more information on academic misconduct and what constitutes cheating and plagiarism, please see academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/Cheating.\nIt is important to note that paraphrasing or quoting another’s work without proper citation is a form of academic misconduct. This includes the R code produced by someone else! Writing code is like writing a paper, it is obvious if you copied-and-pasted a sentence from someone else into your paper because the way each person writes is different.\nEven inadvertent or unintentional misuse or appropriation of another’s work (such as relying heavily on source material that is not expressly acknowledged) is considered plagiarism. This includes using Chat GPT, which should only be used to help you problem solve just as a tutor or peer would, and not as a substitute for your own work. If you are struggling with writing the R code for an assignment, please reach out to me. I would prefer that I get to help you rather than you spending hours Googling things and get nowhere!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways Cite Outside Resources!\n\n\n\nIn this class the assumed knowledge is the course materials, including the course textbook, coursework pages, and course slides. If you use outside resources on assignments I expect that you will cite those resources. This means that\n\nIf you use any R functions or code that are not in the course materials, you must cite where you found it. e.g., if you look up the help file for mutate() and you learn about a function not covered in the course materials, you are required to cite the documentation when using that function.\nIf you use Google you are expected to “inform” me of any resources you used by pasting the link to the resource in a code comment next to where you used that resource.\nIf you use ChatGPT you are expected to “inform” me by stating that you used it in a code comment next to where you used it including the full prompt that you gave ChatGPT.\nIf you work with classmates on an assignment, you are expected to “inform” me by including a note with their names.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions about using and citing sources, you are expected to ask for clarification.",

Alternatively, you can highlight (or simply put your cursor on the line of) the code you want to run and hit ctrl + Enter or ⌘ + Enter.\nYou should see the code appear in the console, as well as the result of the code (2). Keep in mind the [1] before the 2 is vector notation. This means the result is a vector of length 1, whose first element is 2.\nLet’s spice this code up a bit. Delete 1 + 1 from the code chunk and write the following code:\n\n# Load a dataset into the R Environment.\ndata(ToothGrowth)\n# Look at the summary of the variables in the dataset.\nsummary(ToothGrowth)\n\nNow run this code. You should see a six-number summary of the variables len and dose included in the ToothGrowth dataset, as well as the frequency of the levels contained in the supp variable. Further, if you inspect the Environment tab, the ToothGrowth dataset should appear. You can click on the dataset name (not the blue play button!) to look at the data.\n\nCheck the Data Documentation\nIn your console (not in the Quarto document), type ?ToothGrowth (or alternatively help(ToothGrowth).\nUse the information that pops up in the Help pane in RStudio to fill in the blanks below. Add the questions and your responses after the R code chunk. Before the code chunk, create a section header (using #s) that describes the contents of the section (e.g., Tooth Growth Dataset).\nThis dataset investigates the effect of ______ ____ on tooth growth in _________ ________.\nThe two supplement delivery methods include OJ (_______ _______) and VC (_________ ______).\nIt is a data frame with ____ observations and ____ variables.\nYour Tooth Growth Dataset section should look something like this:",

Replace the 2 * 2 code with the following (we will talk about graphics next week!):\n\n# make sure to load the package ggplot2 (or alternatively tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data = ToothGrowth, \n       aes(x = supp,\n           y = len)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs()\n\nNow, run this code chunk! You should see side-by-side boxplots comparing tooth length between the two supplement delivery methods contained in the ToothGrowth data set.\nLook back at the help documentation for the ToothGrowth dataset to determine what len represents (i.e., “Length of xxx”).\nNext, look up the help file on the labs() ggplot2 function to find the arguments you can use to specify the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axis labels. Change the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis labels to display reader-friendly axis labels as found in the ToothGrowth help file. For example, “Supplement Type” is better than “supp”.\nNote that #| echo: false is an output option applied only to this specific code chunk. Remove this line so the code appears in your final rendered document.\nCreate another section header (like you did before) stating what is included in this section.\n\nInserting a New Code Chunk\nNavigate to the last sentence of the Quarto document. We’re now going to insert a new R code chunk at the bottom of the document.\nThere are four different ways to do this:\n\ntype ctrl + alt + i on Windows, or ⌘ + ⌥ + i on macOS,\nClick on the  symbol. This should automatically default to R code, but if you have a Python compiler on your computer, you might need to select “R” from the options.\nIf you are using the Visual editor, click on the “Insert” button, then select “Code Chunk”, and finally select “R”.\nManually add the code chunk by typing ```{r}. Make sure to close your code chunk with ```.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConducting Statistical Analyses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefresher on a two-sample independent t-test\n\n\n\nWhile a second course in statistics is a pre-requisite for this class, you may want to go here for a refresher on conducting two-sample independent t-tests.\n\n\nIn this section, we are going to conduct a two-sample independent t-test to compare tooth length between the two supplement methods in the ToothGrowth dataset. I have outlined the null and alternative hypotheses we will be testing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull\n\n\n\nThe treatment mean tooth length for the OJ supplement delivery method is the same as the treatment mean tooth length for the VC supplement delivery method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative\n\n\n\nThe treatment mean tooth length for the OJ supplement delivery method is different from the treatment mean tooth length for the VC supplement delivery method.\n\n\nCarry out the following steps:\n\nLook up the help documentation for t.test(). Hint: look at the examples at the bottom for comparing extra across groups in the sleep dataset.\nUsing the function t.test(), write code to carry out the analysis. You can assume unequal variances and a two-sided alternative.\nRun your code chunk to obtain the output for your statistical test.\nWrite a numbered list (in Markdown) below the code chunk containing:\n\n\nYour conclusion (in the context of these data) based on the p-value.\nAn interpretation of the confidence interval (make sure to read what confidence level is used by default).\n\n\nCreate another section header, describing the contents of this section.\n\n\n\nRender your Document\nRender your document as an html file. Use the “Render” button (the blue arrow!) at the top of your screen.\nIf you run into trouble rendering your document, try restarting R and running your code chunks in order, and see if you can find the problem.\nAnother common issue is deleting the tick marks (```) that surround your code chunks. If you notice that the code chunks are not showing a “Play” button, or that they are not highlighted in gray, double check your tick marks!\nRecall we included error: true in our YAML execution options. This means that your document will still render even if there are errors. Make sure you are double checking your work!\nYou will notice that there is auto-generated text that is unrelated to the work that you completed. It is always a good idea to delete this extra text!\n\n\nStyling your Quarto Document\nYou can find a list of every option you can use to format an HTML document here and here. Further, here are lists of different themes you can specify in your YAML to produce differently styled outputs.\nMake the following changes to your document:\n\nSpecify “code-folding” in your YAML document options.\nSpecify in the code chunk options that your boxplots of tooth length by supplement delivery method should be center aligned.\nWrite and include a figure caption for the boxplots using a code-chunk option.\n\nYou might have fun playing around with other themes or options!\n\n\nRender again!\nNotice that when you render the document, all of the code reruns again, producing the same output as before, but with your changes – this is called reproducibility!\nYou should render often while completing your practice activities and lab assignments. Make small changes, then make sure the file still renders rather than making a bunch of big changes and then realizing something is wrong.\n\n\nTurn it in!\nOpen the .html file on your computer to make sure it looks as you expected. Then upload the rendered (.html extension) document to Canvas!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nDouble check that you have embed-resources: true in your YAML. Without this, your html will not be formatted correctly on Canvas. You may want to look at what you turn in through your Canvas portal!\n\n\n\nYou’ll be doing this same process for all your future Lab Assignments. Each of these will involve a Quarto file. Some weeks, I may have a template for you to copy into the Quarto file just as with the first practice activity.",
